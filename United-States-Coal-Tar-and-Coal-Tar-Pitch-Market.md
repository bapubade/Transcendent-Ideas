Coal-tar pitch is used in the production of anodes for aluminum smelting, a process that requires high-performance materials to conduct electricity efficiently and withstand extreme temperatures. Coal-tar pitch is combined with petroleum pitch to form the binder that holds the anode components together. The use of coal-tar pitch in aluminum manufacturing is crucial because it ensures the anodes' stability and durability, directly impacting the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the aluminum production process. Additionally, the aluminum industry's expanding global demand, driven by increasing applications in construction, automotive, and packaging, continues to boost the coal-tar pitch market as an essential material in the manufacturing of aluminum. The Graphite Electrodes segment also plays a significant role in the demand for coal-tar pitch in the United States. Coal-tar pitch serves as a binder in the production of graphite electrodes, which are essential for electric arc furnaces (EAF) used in steelmaking. The role of coal-tar pitch is critical in ensuring the strength, electrical conductivity, and heat resistance of graphite electrodes, which are crucial in the steel production process. As the demand for steel continues to rise, particularly in the construction and automotive sectors, the demand for high-quality graphite electrodes, and consequently coal-tar pitch, is expected to grow. The increasing shift towards electric arc furnaces in steel production, driven by energy efficiency and sustainability goals, further solidifies the importance of coal-tar pitch in this application. The roofing industry is another key market for coal-tar pitch, where it is used as a component in the production of bituminous roofing materials. Coal-tar pitch is employed due to its superior waterproofing and durability properties, which make it ideal for flat roofs and areas that require long-lasting protection against the elements. This material is used in the creation of built-up roofing (BUR) systems, which involve layering materials to enhance the roofâ€™s performance. Coal-tar pitch has been the preferred material in roofing applications for decades due to its ability to resist UV degradation and maintain flexibility over time. Despite the increasing popularity of alternative roofing materials, coal-tar pitch continues to be widely used, especially in commercial and industrial buildings where long-term performance and resistance to environmental factors are paramount. The "Other" applications of coal-tar pitch in the United States market are more diverse and encompass a range of niche industries. Coal-tar pitch is used in the production of various specialty chemicals, binders for road construction, and even in the manufacture of carbon black, which is used in the production of tires and rubber products. Additionally, coal-tar pitch finds application in the production of carbon materials for batteries and other electrical components. This category also includes smaller, yet significant applications in industries such as plastics, coatings, and construction. The versatility of coal-tar pitch across different sectors highlights its broad utility and ensures a steady demand in various industrial processes. As new technologies emerge and existing industries evolve, the scope for coal-tar pitch in other applications continues to expand.
